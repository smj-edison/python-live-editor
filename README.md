# Python live editor
This is based on Khan Academy's live editor, except in python. Currently there is no live editing feature, but I want to work on that next.

# Running locally
All you have to do to run locally is run `./build.sh`, and start a server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080` in the build directory.
